        <h2 class="section-title">Hello, my name is Zachary Rypien.</h2>
        <p>
            I have been focused on security within Computer Science since I started university in 2017. Finding basic application development to not be where my heart lies,
            I instead chose to turn my focus on offensive and defensive security, finding a particular love with penetration testing.
            <br><br>
            Another hobby I have in the field is website development, as I think seeing the results of my work in an interesting and unique way - the look of the website updating as I go -
            to be some of the most gratifying work I have done in my life. I hope you enjoy this application!
        </p>

                <h3>Should businesses pay for Ransomware?</h3>
                <h4>Ransomware, Attacks, Encryption</h4>
                <p>
                   One strong method of attack hackers enjoy using is utilizing ransomware - encrypting sensitive company information and only offering the key if the company pays up. Businesses can 
lose millions of dollars when an attack such as this occurs, so the question is asked: Should they pay?
                   Often, when a ransom is paid, not all information is recovered. This is because even if the company pays the attacker, the actual information is still in the attacker's hand. Just 
because they are given the funds does not mean they are willing to part with all of the information that was stolen. In the end, the sensitive data is still in the attacker's hand, and it may never 
leave it.
                   Ultimately, ransomware attacks are out there - unpredicatable and hard to solve. In the end, it is up to the risk analysts and the company that was attacked to decide wheter or not to 
pay the ransom. If the information is important enough, they might. However, this never gurantees the safety of this information. Companies need to be prepared to look for alternatives in order to 
account for the information that went missing - as simply handing some money over does not always solve all issues.

                <h3>Are Humans Really the Weakest Link in Security?</h3>
                <h4>Social Engineering, Phishing, Breaches</h4>
                <p>
                    Society is shaped by humans. Security is no different. People make security, and people break security. Like many forms of technology, the security aspects of it can be rock solid - 
but not solid enough to account for human error.
                    No amount of security in the world can protect a atabase if a disgruntled employee decides to share sensitive login information. Ientity fraud can't always be easily detected if an 
old person is tricked into sharing their sensitive data to a stranger over the phone.
                    Sometimes, one could make weak, easily guessable passwords that are consistently brute-forced through and give attackers what they want. These aspects of humanity can't always be 
prevented, so the best option would be to mitigate them as best as possible. 
                    Getting people to become knowledgable on how human error can lead to security risks is extremely important, and getting them used to mitigating these risks - such as utilizing two 
factor authentication - is extremely important.
